Or would they take a smarter approach which is to incorporate the usage of A.I. into their learning funnels and expand on subjects that cannot be replaced or done by A.I. How about instead of funneling students into degrees that have no merit once they graduate due to the job marketplace of said degree or because of the adoption of A.I. into these workplaces, you make students go for degrees such as learning about A.I., learning about human connection, learning about building communities, skills which A.I. can never replicate nor produce.",Yes,"""Very helpful""","""Very helpful""","""Very helpful""","""Very helpful""","""Very helpful""","""Very helpful""",I believe you should continue incorporating A.I. tools into this course for the foreseeable future.,Other courses not just STA302 should follow this teaching philosophy of using A.I.

Personalized Learning: AI can adapt to individual learning styles and pace, providing tailored explanations and exercises for each student. This personalization can help students grasp concepts more effectively.

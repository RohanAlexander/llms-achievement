Perhaps a recommended quota on the number of interactions students can have with ChatGPT on a particular assignment should be helpful.

But to be honest, based on what I feel about this course, I think that won’t even be a problem. Even if you are using AI in this course, you won’t be able to get a high GPA if you don’t actually know and understand what are you writting, since AI are not as inteligent to develope a paper without enough support from the user. If you actually understand the content, then I would say no matter how you complete the work (either you write it or you let AI write it)will be not that important, because you actually got the knowledge, which I think is the ultimate goal of study.",NA,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0

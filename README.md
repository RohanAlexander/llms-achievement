# *Working Paper*: Usage of LLM Tools and Student Performance

## Overview

This repo contains the materials and work for a working paper studying the relationship between the usage of LLM tools like ChatGPT and student educational achievement, using data from undergraduate performance in an upper-level Statistics course as a key example.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from X.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of models like GitHub Copilot and GPT-4o. The [parts of the paper] were written with the help of Claude-3.5 Sonnet. The entire chat history with each particular model is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.

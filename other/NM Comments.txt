NM Comments (I’m not familiar with 0-1 inflated beta regression so I’ll leave these as comments
to be considered)
• The text refers to a zero-one inflated beta, but the code chunk below is for a one-inflated
model (linked to the zero-or-one inflated beta referenced, if I understand correctly). I
think the text should be updated
• Is the Kurz (2023) reference correct? It looks like this is for standard beta regression, so
perhaps an additional reference to one-inflated beta regression would be helpful (e.g. Os-
pina 2012)

• Regarding 𝜋𝑧𝑜𝑖 and 𝜋𝑐𝑜𝑖 - based on the descriptions it seems like these should sum to
1, but if that’s the case it’s not clear to me why we would model both. I suspect I’m
missing something here, but tweaking the descriptions could help
• llm_usage is in the model as a categorical variable, do we want to make that explicit in
the model descriptions?
• Related to the above, perhaps it makes more sense to have “None” as the reference level
for llm_usage instead of “Extensive”
• I typically prefer not to have raw variable names in the body of a paper, so if there’s a
way to do that without being to cumbersome that could be good (perhaps a personal
preference though)
• Similarly, in Table 5 is it possible to use the mathematical notation instead of the variable
names?
• In Figure 5 is it possible to have different symbols for the two models to make it more
readable in grayscale?
• [Related to section 5.1]: There are references to how students used LLMs (e.g. to write
code/text, as an alternative search engine), and I’m just curious where this information
comes from. Were the LLM usage statements submitted and analysed, or is this more
annecdotal? Either way, I think a bit more context about where it came from would
help give the reader context.
